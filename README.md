# Candle_Lock2
4 flickering (WS2812b) candles, Blown out in order trigger event on pin 
In my project I used 4 cheap digital knock sensors, removed the spring trigger and installed an electret element.
when the player blows on the element it triggers the sensor. sensitivity can be adjusted to eliminate false triggers by ambient noise.
